6.2假设需要 你制作3块蓝莓蛋糕。蛋糕的配料如下: .
1杯黄油，软化后再用
1杯糖
4个大鸡蛋
1茶匙香草精;
0.5茶匙盐
0.25茶匙肉豆蔻
1.5杯面粉
1杯蓝莓
蛋糕的制作流程如下:
第1步:烤箱预热至160C (325"F)。 在烤盘上抹黄油和一层薄薄的面粉。
第2步:在一只大碗中使用搅拌器以中速将奶油和糖混合在一起，直到松发。再加鸡蛋、香草
精、盐和肉豆蔻，搅拌到完全混合。将搅拌器降到低速，一次加入0.5杯面粉，搅拌到完全
混合。
第3步:最后慢慢加入蓝莓，将蛋糕均匀地放在烤盘中，烘烤约60分钟。
6.2.1 [5] <6. 2>你的任务是尽可能高效率地完成3块蛋糕。假定只有一个能容纳一块蛋糕的烤箱、- .
个大碗、一个烤盘、一个搅拌器，请做出合理的调度以尽可能快地完成任务，并分析瓶颈所在。
6.2.2 [5] <6. 2>假设你现在有3个碗、3个蛋糕盘子和3个搅拌器。你拥有这些增加的资源后，现在
的工序加快了多少?
6.2.3 [5] <6.2 >假设你现在有两个朋友，可帮你烹饪，并且你有一个可容纳3个蛋糕的大烤箱。这些
将对练习题6.2.1中的计划有何改变?
6.2.4 [5] <6. 2 >将制作蛋糕与并行计算机中的循环迭代进行类比。分析制作蛋糕的循环中存在的数据
级并行和任务级并行。

答:
6.2.1 For this set of resources, we can pipeline the preparation. We assume that
we do not have to reheat the oven for each cake.
Preheat Oven
Mix ingredients in bowl for Cake 1
Fill cake pan with contents of bowl and bake Cake 1. Mix ingredients for
Cake 2 in bowl.
Finish baking Cake 1. Empty cake pan. Fill cake pan with bowl contents for
Cake 2 and bake Cake 2. Mix ingredients in bowl for Cake 3.
Finish baking Cake 2. Empty cake pan. Fill cake pan with bowl contents for
Cake 3 and bake Cake 3.
Finish baking Cake 3. Empty cake pan.
       time
cake1   x x x
cake2       x x x
cake3           x x x



6.2.2 Now we have 3 bowls, 3 cake pans and 3 mixers. We will name them A, B,
and C.
Preheat Oven
Mix incredients in bowl A for Cake 1
Fill cake pan A with contents of bowl A and bake for Cake 1. Mix ingredients
for
Cake 2 in bowl A.
Finish baking Cake 1. Empty cake pan A. Fill cake pan A with contents of
bowl A for Cake 2. Mix ingredients in bowl A for Cake 3.
Finishing baking Cake 2. Empty cake pan A. Fill cake pan A with contents
of bowl A for Cake 3.
Finish baking Cake 3. Empty cake pan A. .
The point here is that we cannot carry out any of these items in parallel
because we either have one person doing the work, or we have limited
capacity in our oven.

       time
cake1   x x x
cake2       x x x
cake3           x x x

6.2.3 Each step can be done in parallel for each cake. The time to bake 1 cake, 2
cakes or 3 cakes is exactly the same.
       time
cake1   x x x
cake2   x x x
cake3   x x x

6.2.4 The loop computation is equivalent to the steps involved to make one cake.
Given that we have multiple processors (or ovens and cooks), we can execute
instructions (or cook multiple cakes) in parallel. The instructions in the loop (or
cooking steps) may have some dependencies on prior instructions (or cooking
steps) in the loop body (cooking a single cake).
Data-level parallelism occurs when loop iterations are independent (i.e, no
loop carried dependencies).
Task-level parallelism includes any instructions that can be computed on
parallel execution units, are similar to the independent operations involved
in making multiple cakes.
