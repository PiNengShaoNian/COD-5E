3.3 [10]<3.2>将5ED4转换成二进制数。使用十六进制表示计算机中的数值很具有吸引力的原因是
什么?

答
0b0101 1110 1101 0100

The attraction is that each hex digit contains one of 16 different characters
(0-9,A-E). Since with 4 binary bits you can represent 16 differnt pattern,
in hex each digit requires exactly 4 binary bits, And bytes are by defination 8
long, so two hex digits are all that are required to represent the contents of 1 byte.
